An e-commerce application using Blazor. I have used the Blazor server and web assembly project, 
where the Blazor server project is responsible for the client's admin panel and web assembly. I have 
used the asp.net identity for authentication and authorization. I also developed an API project for 
communicating with the web assembly project
